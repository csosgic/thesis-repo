\section{Definition smart grid}
The Smart Grid is a comprehensive electrical network that employs cutting-edge communication technologies, computational intelligence, and cybersecurity protocols throughout the entire process of generating, transmitting, distributing, and consuming electricity. Its objective is to establish a system that is environmentally friendly, secure, dependable, adaptable, energy-efficient, and environmentally sustainable. While the ultimate vision of the Smart Grid is ambitious, its practical implementation demands careful evaluation of costs, rigorous testing, and validation. Introducing new functionalities can occur autonomously, with each necessitating justification and a reasonable return on investment. The compatibility of open systems facilitates smooth integration into the Smart Grid once the technologies have been validated \cite{gharavi2011smart}.
 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), operating within the U.S. Department of Commerce, has classified the smart grid into seven distinct domains, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:NIST}. A concise overview of these domains and their stakeholders is provided in Table \ref{table:domains}.\cite{gopstein2021nist}

\section{Smart Grid Technologies }
A smart grid employs a diverse array of technologies and communication networks to enhance the management of power generation, transmission, and distribution. It also provides customers with the ability to have real-time control over their energy consumption \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.
\subsection{Major Smart Grid Technologies}
\subsubsection{Advanced Demand Forecasting}
Utilizing data analytics and machine learning (ML), advanced demand forecasting techniques produce forecasting reports through autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and various statistical methods.

A crucial aspect of smart grid management, ARIMA forecasting predicts both annual electricity consumption and hourly electricity prices.

Furthermore, ARIMA forecasting serves as an extra layer of verification, aiding in the identification of cyber intrusion attempts on smart meters used to measure electricity usage for residential and commercial consumers \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.
\subsubsection{Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)}

AMI facilitates two-way communication between customers and utilities, offering a wide array of advantages to the smart grid. These include forecasting consumption, improving revenue collection and theft detection, detecting faults and outages, measuring losses, and implementing time-based pricing \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.  
\subsubsection{Big Data}
Smart grid data possesses three fundamental characteristics: high velocity, extensive volume, and diverse variety. Managing this large volume of data in a timely manner with limited resources poses a significant challenge for smart grids. This is where big data analytics becomes pivotal, offering the potential to boost asset utilization, efficiency, system reliability, and customer satisfaction.

Without big data analytics in the smart grid, the assessment of petabytes of data generated by smart grid devices would be impractical. Big data captures and analyzes unstructured data from various endpoints within a smart grid.

Moreover, big data facilitates efficient cost reduction, optimal resource distribution, and improved customer service \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.
\subsubsection{Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)}
Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) supply energy and improve local reliability, enhancing grid stability and optimizing on-site fuel utilization.

DERs encompass various technologies such as electric vehicles, solar panels, small natural gas generators, and controllable loads like electric water heaters and HVAC systems.

Efficient integration of DERs enhances grid service quality and reliability. For instance, photovoltaic systems (PVs) utilize the photovoltaic effect to convert sunlight into electricity, which is then transformed into alternating current by an inverter. The primary advantage of PV systems is reduced utility bills due to decreased reliance on grid-provided electricity \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.
\subsubsection{Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)}
Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), also known as non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM), discerns the specific energy consumption of households and industrial sites.

By disaggregating the total energy usage (from active appliances) into individual components and offering diagnostic insights, NILM aids in identifying energy-intensive or faulty appliances.

Moreover, consumers can optimize the timing of usage for energy-intensive appliances to minimize costs, and monitor and control energy expenses based on their power consumption \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}. 
\subsubsection{Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)}
Also known as vehicle-grid integration (VGI), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology transfers unused power from a vehicle into the smart grid. An electric vehicle (EV) battery is a cost-efficient form of energy storage.

 

V2G helps balance electricity consumption spikes and reduce overload on the power grid during peak hours.

 

For example, V2G can feed energy (unused battery capacity) back to the power grid from an electric car’s battery to improve grid stability and maximize the benefits of renewable energy \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.

 \subsection{Established and Emerging Smart Grid Communication Networks}
 \subsubsection{HAN}
 A smart meter supplies power to household appliances via the Home Area Network (HAN), which utilizes different technologies such as Bluetooth, Wireless Ethernet, Wired Ethernet, and Zigbee. The HAN links home appliances with the smart meter, which detects power usage and transmits this information to the server for billing purposes \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.
 \subsubsection{NAN}
 A Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) is an external access network that links distribution automation devices and smart meters to WAN gateways such as RF (radio frequency) collectors and field devices (like Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)). NAN allows for customer data collection and facilitates communication within the WAN-premise area \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.
 \subsubsection{WAN}
 A wide area network (WAN) uses fiber optics, 3G/LTE (Long Term Evolution)/GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), or WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) for communication between a smart meter, suppliers, and the utility server. A smart meter sends notifications it receives (via HAN) from the devices to the suppliers using WAN \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}. 
 \subsubsection{LoRaWAN}
 LoRa (Long Range) is a popular IoT (Internet of Things) technology known for its long-range capability and low-power wireless platform, making it well-suited for various applications including energy management, infrastructure efficiency, and disaster prevention.

 Implementing smart electricity metering solutions and smart grid networks using the LoRaWAN® (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol allows for improved understanding of power demand, efficient detection of power outages, enhanced connectivity, and identification of underperforming assets.
 
 Additionally, LoRaWAN is globally compatible and ensures seamless transmission without interference for remote reading of heat meter consumption data \cite{WhatIsSmartgrid}.
\section{Components of the Smart Grid }  
There are many components, but will talk about the most important ones.
\subsection{Smart Meters}
The interplay between smart meters and smart grids is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:SmartMeter}. From the perspective of the smart grid, the applications primarily revolve around leveraging smart meters to facilitate the coordination of various electrical devices, thereby achieving a dependable power system. Simultaneously, these applications strive to enhance the performance and efficiency of smart metering. These objectives align with the defining characteristics of smart grids, which drive the advancement of smart meter technologies.\cite{chen2023control}

	\label{fig:SmartMeter}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\subsection{Advanced Distribution Management Systems }
An ADMS is a software platform designed to support the comprehensive suite of tasks related to managing and optimizing the distribution of electricity. It encompasses functions that automate outage recovery and enhance the effectiveness of the distribution grid. These functions being developed for electric utilities include fault location, isolation, and restoration; optimization of voltage and reactive power; energy conservation through voltage reduction; management of peak demand; as well as support for microgrids and electric vehicles \cite{avazov2016advanced}.

% \item \textbf{  Real-Time Monitoring: }They keep a vigilant eye on the grid, promptly detecting issues like outages.

% \item \textbf{  Rerouting Electricity: }When problems arise, ADMS reroutes electricity to minimize disruptions.

% \end{itemize}


\subsection{Super conducting cables}
These components are utilized for transmitting electricity over extended distances and employing automated monitoring and analysis tools. These tools have the capability to identify faults independently or predict potential cable failures by analyzing real-time data, weather conditions, and the history of outages \cite{elprocus_smartgrid}.
\subsection{Circuit breakers}
The circuit breaker, a safety-conscious middle-aged individual, safeguards the power system. It evaluates smart grid scenarios against safety standards, offering recommendations. Despite occasional differences, both the smart grid and circuit breakers recognize their mutual importance. Their relationship ensures the power system’s safe and stable operation.

Smart Grid occasionally proposes innovative features or adjustments to the power system. However, the breaker gently dissuades excessive risk-taking, emphasizing safety. Through discussions and disputes, they strike a balance, ensuring reliable electricity for our lives \cite{linkedin_smartgrid_circuitbreaker}.
\subsection{Collector nodes}

Collector nodes are pivotal in the Smart Grid, serving as points of data collection and distribution between energy suppliers and customers. They enable a two-way communication network within the grid, relaying information from customer premises to the utility control center and transmission/distribution substations. Collector nodes facilitate efficient monitoring and management of energy usage \cite{cunjiang2012architecture}.

\section{Challenges and Considerations  }  
\subsection{Stakeholder Engagement}
At the early stages of smart grid implementations, stakeholders’ negative perceptions can derail even the most beneficial project, especially when the proponents fail to pay close attention to the educational aspects. Advocates need to be able explain and clearly identify the benefits of each component of the smart grid to the customers that are the potential key to service success \cite{el2014smart}.
\subsection{Fear of obsolesce}
As many technology users (computers, smart phones, etc.) are painfully aware, the adoption of new tools can open the door to new and additional costs that may only be borne by the eventual consumer. This fear can be addressed through the development of interoperability standards and backward compatibility of technologies \cite{el2014smart}.
\subsection{Cybersecurity}
Without a shred of doubt, cybersecurity stands out as one of the foremost and intricate challenges confronting IoT devices. Sensors, devices, and networks connected to the internet are persistent targets for various online threats like probing, espionage, ransomware, theft, and potential destruction. Considering that an IoT-driven smart grid can encompass potentially millions of interconnected nodes spread across extensive geographic regions, it emerges as the most susceptible to substantial cyber assaults. Consequently, a cyber-attack on such a system would have devastating consequences, leading to significant financial losses and potentially bringing entire countries to a standstill. The diagram in Figure \ref{fig:attacks} illustrates the number of articles reviewed per year of publication and smart grids impacted by cyber-attacks. Hence, security stands as a major hurdle in both the deployment and operation of IoT-based smart grid networks.\cite{kimani2019cyber}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/attack.png}
	\caption{Estimate: cyber attacks will increase exponentially \cite{mdpi-link}}
	\label{fig:attacks}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data privacy}
Privacy is a critical concern within smart grid networks, prompting significant questions about the creation of policies regarding user data privacy. These questions revolve around several key points: Who owns the customer data? How is access to and usage of customer data regulated? What measures exist to protect the privacy and security of customer data from potential risks like surveillance or illicit activities? Is it permissible to sell or transfer customer data, and under what circumstances and for whose benefit? In areas with retail choice, are measures necessary to ensure that competing electricity providers have equal access to customer data compared to the incumbent utility?

In competitive environments among electricity providers, access to users' electricity usage patterns and behavioral information holds significant importance. Providers or their representatives may use this data to develop business strategies and create tailored packages or offers. In an open market scenario, some data may be disclosed after offers are made public, providing a level playing field for information access. However, if privacy is compromised beforehand, with specific user data available to only certain parties, these electricity providers could potentially gain unfair advantages. Therefore, effective privacy policies are essential to prevent the exploitation of unfair means in shaping business strategies.

The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) into smart grid operations introduces various privacy concerns. Depending on how a consumer uses and recharges electricity \cite{zeadally2013towards}.

\subsection{Cost of Implementation:}

Estimating Smart Grid costs poses challenges due to several factors. Integrating digital technology into Smart Grids introduces complexities, as the failure rates and life expectancy of embedded assets differ from traditional grid technologies. For instance, a substation transformer designed for 40 years may be coupled with information technology lasting 10, 15, or 20 years, necessitating careful cost considerations for upgrades. Additionally, the rapid obsolescence of digital tech complicates estimates, as advancing communications and computational capabilities may render Smart Grid components obsolete before their intended lifespan ends. 

Moreover, the evolution of Smart Grid technologies is expected to outpace conventional tech in terms of cost reduction and advancements. However, uncertainties persist, particularly with new and unproven Smart Grid technologies. If their performance is subpar or degrades unexpectedly, it could jeopardize the entire technology's viability and business plan. As Smart Grid component costs decrease rapidly due to maturation and increased production, estimating replacement costs becomes challenging\cite{smartgrid}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/cost.PNG}
	\caption{Grid Component Costs \cite{smartgrid}}
	\label{fig:costs}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Regulatory Frameworks}
Electric distribution systems across Europe are encountering significant hurdles stemming from climate change objectives, evolving market frameworks, and technological advancements. These factors will have a profound impact on the responsibilities of distribution system operators. The challenges' nature and magnitude are primarily influenced by Europe's vision and strategies regarding climate and energy. This research aims to identify which policies might pose obstacles to innovation in distribution grids and the adoption of advanced smart grid solutions developed within the UNITED-GRID project. Following an in-depth examination of emerging policy priorities within the energy and climate framework, as well as electricity market design, and subsequent consultations with three partner distribution system operators, five key barriers have been pinpointed. The findings indicate that ambitious decarbonisation targets and shifting expectations regarding the role of distribution system operators in the energy landscape necessitate more adaptable and efficient network management. However, rigid income frameworks, insufficient incentives for innovation, and regulatory uncertainties impede the modernisation of distribution systems. It can be inferred that these concerns heighten the risks for distribution system operators and must be taken into account by research initiatives and developers of smart grid solutions to successfully implement and achieve market adoption of the developed solutions \cite{rossi2020study}.
