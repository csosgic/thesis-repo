I. Contributions
    Introduction
        In this chapter, we present the key contributions of our project on developing a deep learning-based intrusion detection system for the cybersecurity of smart grid communication infrastructure. The increasing reliance on smart grid technology has led to a significant expansion of the communication infrastructure, which has, in turn, created new vulnerabilities and opportunities for cyber threats. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning approach that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of intrusion detection in smart grid communication infrastructure.
    Theoretical Proposal
        a. Project Description
        The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a deep learning-based intrusion detection system that can effectively detect and mitigate cyber threats in smart grid communication infrastructure. The proposed system will utilize a combination of CNN and LSTM architectures to capture both the spatial and temporal features of network traffic data, enabling it to identify complex and sophisticated attack patterns.
        b. Project Design
            The project design consists of the following key components:
                - Data Collection: Collect network traffic data from smart grid communication infrastructure using tools such as Snort or Bro.
                - Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data to extract relevant features and prepare it for the deep learning models.
                - Feature Engineering: Engineer features from the preprocessed data using techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, or autoencoders to enhance the performance of the deep learning models.
                - CNN-LSTM Model: Implement a hybrid deep learning model that combines CNN and LSTM architectures to capture both spatial and temporal features of the network traffic data.
                - Model Training and Evaluation: Train the deep learning model using the engineered features and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
                - Model Deployment: Deploy the trained deep learning model in the smart grid communication infrastructure to detect and mitigate cyber threats in real-time.
        c. System Architecture
            The system architecture for the proposed deep learning-based intrusion detection system consists of the following components:
                - Data Collection Module: Responsible for collecting network traffic data from the smart grid communication infrastructure.
                - Data Preprocessing Module: Preprocesses the collected data to extract relevant features and prepare it for the deep learning models.
                - Feature Engineering Module: Applies feature engineering techniques to enhance the performance of the deep learning models.
                - CNN-LSTM Model: The hybrid deep learning model that combines CNN and LSTM architectures to detect intrusions in the smart grid communication infrastructure.
                - Evaluation Module: Evaluates the performance of the deep learning model using various metrics.
                - Deployment Module: Deploys the trained deep learning model in the smart grid communication infrastructure for real-time intrusion detection and mitigation.
        d. Process Used in Project Development
            The project development process consists of the following steps:
                - Data Collection: Collect network traffic data from the smart grid communication infrastructure using tools such as Snort or Bro.
                - Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data using techniques such as normalization, feature scaling, and data transformation.
                - Feature Engineering: Engineer features from the preprocessed data using techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, or autoencoders.
                - CNN-LSTM Model Implementation: Implement the hybrid deep learning model using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
                - Model Training and Evaluation: Train the deep learning model using the engineered features and evaluate its performance using the metrics mentioned above.
